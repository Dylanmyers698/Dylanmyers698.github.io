            Nutrition plays a vital role in maintaining overall health and well-being. A balanced diet provides essential nutrients, 
            including vitamins, minerals, and macronutrients that support bodily functions. Consuming a variety of fruits, vegetables, 
            whole grains, and lean proteins can enhance energy levels, boost immunity, and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such 
            as diabetes and heart disease. Proper nutrition also contributes to mental clarity and emotional stability.
